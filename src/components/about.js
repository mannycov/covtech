              <p>My name is Emanuel Covarrubias and I am a full stack software engineer with a focus on web applications. I love to code because I find the process of problem solving very satisfying and I enjoy watching an idea for a project take shape and materialize.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p> I build full stack applications on my own as well as in groups of engineers using the latest technology stacks. I love seeing new technologies in the community arise and Iâ€™m always excited to learn about them. I also am a lover of learning in general, a problem solver, and a fitness enthusiast. Please get in touch if you'd like to know more.
